## Covid Data

```{r covid}

#load covid data from csv file
original_covid_df <- read.csv("owid-covid-data.csv")

```


```{r dataset, echo=FALSE}

#create a new dataset that includes all dates

#get all country codes
iso_code_list <- original_covid_df %>% 
  select(iso_code) %>% 
  unique()

#generate dates
dates <- seq.Date(min(as.Date("2020-01-01")), 
                  max(as.Date("2021-07-19")), by = "day")

#assign every date to every iso code
iso_date <- crossing(dates, iso_code_list)

# we need to joins -
# 1) where all data is same for every date
# 2) where we only copy data per existing date (and then backfill rest)







```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
